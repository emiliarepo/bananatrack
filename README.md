# BananaTrack

## About The Project

BananaTrack is a simple website for keeping track of the everchanging banana prices at Finnish grocery stores.
It can only scrape S Group chains automatically as Kesko's sites are blocked by a captcha.

There's an extra tool to scan Kesko stores and create a JSON file of the prices:
